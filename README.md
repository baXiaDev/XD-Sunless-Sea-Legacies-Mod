# XD-Sunless-Sea-Legacies-Mod
Pre-release version

\*\*\*First time using GitHub\*\*\*

Not really sure what to put here at the moment.

## —DISCLAIMER—
- Always make a backup of your save file. (Unfortunately, I have not found a way to uninstall the mod and have the save file work afterwards. If anyone has a fix for this, let me know.)
- Certain stories may have spoilers. (Important if you decide to help with testing. I might be able to make a modified version for testers that omits the story spoilers.)

I’ve included a save file for testing purposes. It includes the three items you would need to test story and functionality. It also includes about 2000 echo to upgrade your lodgings to test The Zong of the Zee legacy item.

## Instructions
1. BACKUP YOUR OWN SAVE FILE!
2. Download zip file and extract.
2. Copy "XD-Legacies" folder to "%UserProfile%\AppData\LocalLow\Failbetter Games\Sunless Sea\addon\"
3. \*If you are testing\* Copy "Autosave.json" to "%UserProfile%\AppData\LocalLow\Failbetter Games\Sunless Sea\saves\"

### New Legacy Items:
- Deeds to a Steam-Yacht
- The Zong of the Zee
- The Fulgent Impeller

### Possible Future Legacy Items (to be added):
- Parabox
- The Serpentine
- The Memento Mori

### Notes:
- To add *Deed to a Steam-Yacht* as a legacy item, chose said item in quest line, storylet will be added to the end.
- To add *The Zong of the Zee* as a legacy item, have item, then retire.
- To add *The Fulgent Impeller* as a legacy item, visit The Brass Embassy in London.
- *The Zong of the Zee* and *The Fulgent Impeller* legacy items have reduced stats.
- *The Zong of the Zee* has been changed to the bridge slot on your ship.

### Ambition:
- [x] Add to GitHub and Steam community forums
- [ ] Add legacy quest for random quest related to *The Fulgent Impeller*
- [ ] Add additional crew storylet for upgrading to the Steam-Yacht
- [ ] Add quests to upgrade legacy items into original items
