# XD-Sunless-Sea-Legacies-Mod
Pre-release version
***First time using GitHub***
Not really sure what to put here at the moment.

## —DISCLAIMER—
- Always make a backup of your save file. (Unfortunately, I have not found a way to uninstall the mod and have the save file work afterwards. If anyone has a fix for this, let me know.)
- Certain stories may have spoilers. (Important if you decide to help with testing. I might be able to make a modified version for testers that omits the story spoilers.)

I’ve included a save file for testing purposes. It includes the three items you would need to test story and functionality. It also includes about 2000 echo to upgrade your lodgings to test The Zong of the Zee legacy item.

### New Legacy Items:
- Deeds to a Steam-Yacht
- The Zong of the Zee
- The Fulgent Impeller

### Possible Future Legacy Items (to be added):
- Parabox
- The Serpentine
- The Memento Mori
